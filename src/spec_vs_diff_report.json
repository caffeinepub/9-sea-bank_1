  "summary": "Most requested frontend pages and React Query hooks appear to be implemented, along with a single-actor Motoko backend containing per-user (Principal-keyed) storage types for transfers, cards, loans, insurance, and EMI plans. The diff also introduces additional, non-requested authorization/admin-token initialization and a user profile setup flow.",

      "description": "Custom access-control/authorization layer with admin secret token initialization (beyond Internet Identity-only auth requirement).",
      "reason": "BuildRequest only asks for Internet Identity sign-in/out and user-scoped persistence; it explicitly lists no third-party auth providers. Adding an admin-token based access-control initialization is extra and not requested.",

        "backend/main.mo (imports authorization/MixinAuthorization and authorization/access-control; permission checks with Runtime.trap(\"Unauthorized...\") )",
